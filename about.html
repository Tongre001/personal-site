			I am assuming that you are here because we either met in person and you got my card, one of my friends, a 
			recruiter from linkedin, someone who is searching for software engineer/developer, or someone who I met in person,
			gave my card to, who is now one of my friends, who works as a recruiter, who is searching for a software engineer/developer.
			That last one is a mouthful, but you are in the right spot if you are any or all of these. I have organized the following headers
			in the following order: what are my values<a href="#val"></a>, <a href="#edu">education</a>, 
			where I <a href="#work">worked</a>, and my <a href="#skills">hard and soft skills.</a> I hope I am good fit for what you are looking for 
			and thanks for checking out my website. If you have a critique for my website please fill out a form <a href="contact.html">here</a>. I enjoy hearing
			feedback and ways to improve my site. The resume is at the bottom if you want to glance at that. 
			</p>
			
		<h1 id="val">Values</h1>
			<p style="text-indent:0px">Both of my parents are immigrants from Mexico and they value hard work and education.</p>
			<h2>Learn from others to do it yourself</h2>
			<p>
			My mom never finished elementary school, because she chose to work at a very young age to help her grandfather around the house.
			Her father worked in the vineyards in Napa and saved up until he was able to bring his 9 children over to the US. All of my aunts 
			and uncles now work and live near or in Calistoga, but each of them always encouraged me to be good in school and get an education.
			My uncles always enjoyed doing carpentry and speaking truthfully, I never enjoyed it, however, the results were always spectacular. 
			The one thing that they always said that stuck to me was that even thoughI did not want to do the work, I should suck it up and 
			learn because you never know when it is going to come in handy. Instead of calling someone to do it for you, you can save a buck or 
			two knowing how to do it yourself. 
			</p>
			
			<h2>Education and Hardwork</h2>
			<p>My father was on his last year of high-school when he decided to migrate over to the US for a better life.
			He is very proud of his independence and his hard work. He became a contractor and he made me go to work with him (sometimes) when I was 
			very young. I remember playing with the rubble sometimes when he would break down the walls. Then, when I was 12, he made me start working 
			with him, which I greatly valued. He took me to many houses during the year and it made me dream that one day I could live in one of those houses and 
			he said that one day I can but only if I work hard for them. That wasn't the only lesson I got from him though. At some point I dreaded working
			with him, because the work was so heavy; having to carry 65 pound buckets up the ladder, carry 80 pound sacks of cement, and having to set up scaffolding 
			2 stories high. By the time I was 18 it was the only thing I knew how to work in and my dad kept saying that if I didn't go to school I might end up 
			like him. I am not complaining, all I am saying is that it scared me, and I knew that I didn't want to do it all of my life.
			From working with him, I learned two things: not take things for granted and that education would bring to me an enjoyable job. 
			</p>
			
		<h1 id="edu">Education</h1>
			<p>
				Graduated Albright college with a Bachelor's of Science in Game Design and Simulation. Although its seems specifically for  video games, I 
				like to break it up as Computer Science and Graphic Design for those who are looking for those two specifications. The classes I took
				regarding my major included:
			</p>
				<ul style="margin-left:60px;font-size:25px;">
					<li>Inroduction to python</li>
					<li>Introduction to Java</li>
					<li>Algorithms</li>
					<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
					<li style="list-style-type:none"></li>
					<li>Graphic Design</li>
					<li>Game audio, Game making, Game History</li>
				</ul>
			<p>
				I also had some time to study abroad at the Top School of Marketing and Administration (ESPM) in Brazil. 
				There I learned portuguese and also took 3D animation and another graphic design course. 
			</p>

		<h1 id="work">Work</h1>
			<p>
			I have only worked in a few places so this should be short. I have worked at:
				<ul style="margin-left:60px; font-size:25px;">
					<li>Calistoga Balloons</li>
					<li>Calistoga Boys and Girls Club </li>
					<li>Meridian Management Group (as a temp through Premier)</li>
					<li>Event Staff for DreamForce (through Premier)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>I know I mentioned that I worked with my dad before but I assume that it wouldn't be really relevant. My dad is brutally honest though so 
			he might give a very balanced review about how messy I was organzing planks or about how fast and efficient I was bringing him the stucco. 
			I worked with him for about 8 years so there are many good days and bad days. 
			</p>
